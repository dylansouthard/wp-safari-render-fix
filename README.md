# Safari 18 Temporary Fix for WordPress Admin Layout Issues

A temporary workaround for layout issues in Safari 18 affecting the WordPress admin interface, particularly related to Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) not rendering properly due to negative margins and floats. This fix targets .postbox-container elements to correct rendering quirks and ensure ACF fields display correctly. Use with caution as it may have unintended global effects within the WordPress admin area.

## Usage

This fix targets `.postbox-container` and prevents unwanted clearing behavior caused by Safari 18's rendering quirks. It applies specific `clear` rules to correct the layout.

## Important Notes

- **Workaround**: This is a hack-y workaround specifically for Safari 18. It may have unintended side effects on other parts of the admin layout.
- **Global Impact**: Use this fix with **extreme caution** as it applies globally to the WordPress admin area. This may have negative effects on other layouts or interfere with unrelated elements.
- **Scope**: This code is applied only to the WordPress admin area and should not impact front-end rendering.
- **Temporary Solution**: It is intended as a temporary solution. You should monitor for Safari updates that resolve this issue and remove the fix when appropriate.
- **Test Carefully**: Be sure to test this fix thoroughly to ensure it doesn't interfere with other elements or functionality in your WordPress admin interface.
